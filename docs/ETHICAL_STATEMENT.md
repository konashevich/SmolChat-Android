# Crisis AI â€“ Ethical Subscription Statement

Crisis AI is designed first for resilience and human survival. Revenue enforcement is best-effort when the world is functioning. If prolonged infrastructure failure (e.g. major disaster, global network collapse) prevents normal subscription verification, the app continues in Survival Mode with full offline functionality so users are never locked out of critical local AI assistance.

User pledge (honor system): When connectivity and normal digital commerce return, users who relied on Survival Mode should renew their annual subscription to continue supporting maintenance and future improvements.

Core principles:
1. Never block life-critical offline capabilities due to inability to contact billing services.
2. Minimal friction in normal times: standard Play Billing flow, single annual product.
3. Respect genuine cancellations and refunds when online.
4. Gentle honesty-based renewal prompts after returning from prolonged offline survival periods.
5. Fail safe: on data corruption or clock anomalies, prefer continued access over denial.

Transparency:
The local entitlement record is stored in simple JSON. It can survive without encryption to reduce risk of unreadability during extreme conditions. Tamper resistance is intentionally light to avoid locking out legitimate users.

Thanks for supporting a resilience-first approach. Renew when you can. Survive when you must.
